# WeightConverter
2 different ways of converting between grams and ounces.


### Part 1, C#
This project contains a .dll file containing 2 methods allowing for conversion between grams and ounces. This .dll file is then used on a server to take simultanious requests from multiple clients over TCP, allowing the clients to specificy the desired conversion and then the server will respond with the result.


### Part 2, TypeScript
Here a completely separate web-application is allowing users to input either a given value and then click a button to convert to either grams or ounces. At the time of writing the web-application is online at https://converternsc.azurewebsites.net/.
